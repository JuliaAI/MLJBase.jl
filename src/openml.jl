Load the OpenML dataset with specified `id`, from those listed on the

Returns a "row table", i.e., a `Vector` of identically typed
`NamedTuple`s. A row table is compatible with the
[Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) interface and can
therefore be readily converted to other compatible formats. For
example:

```julia
using DataFrames
rowtable = OpenML.load(61);
df = DataFrame(rowtable);
df2 = coerce(df, :class=>Multiclass)

List datasets, possibly filtered by a range of properties.
Any number of properties can be combined by listing them one after
the other in the
form '/data/list/{filter}/{value}/{filter}/{value}/...'
Returns an array with all datasets that match the constraints.

Any combination of these filters /limit/{limit}/offset/{offset} -
returns only {limit} results starting from result number {offset}.
Useful for paginating results. With /limit/5/offset/10,
    results 11..15 will be returned.

Both limit and offset need to be specified.
/status/{status} - returns only datasets with a given status,
either 'active', 'deactivated', or 'in_preparation'.
/tag/{tag} - returns only datasets tagged with the given tag.
/{data_quality}/{range} - returns only tasks for which the
underlying datasets have certain qualities.
{data_quality} can be data_id, data_name, data_version, number_instances,
number_features, number_classes, number_missing_values. {range} can be a
specific value or a range in the form 'low..high'.
Multiple qualities can be combined, as in
'number_instances/0..50/number_features/0..10'.
